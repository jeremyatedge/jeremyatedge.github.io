Hey guys! Welcome to my personal website! I am curently a 3rd year Ph.D. student in the University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC), My research mainly focus on Embedded AI, FPGA Acceleration and Reinforcement Learning. I will share useful learning resources, research experiences in my page.

I am currently focus on adaptive scheduling on embedded devices using reinforcement learning techniques. If you are interested in my research, feel free to contact me ^_^
