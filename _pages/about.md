Hey guys! Welcome to my personal website! I am curently a 3rd year Ph.D. student in the University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC), My research interests are adaptive scheduling in embedded (computing) systems, Reinforcement Learning. I will share research news and experiences in my page.

I am currently focusing on different AI(especially RL)-based adaptive scheduling policies on edge computing devices. If you are interested in my research, feel free to contact me.
